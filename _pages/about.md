<!-- Hanlin Sheng currently works at [Computational Interpretation Group](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/hanlin/list.htm), the School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Prof. Xinming Wu. Hanlin does research in Geophysics and Artificial Intelligence. -->

Hello! I'm a Deep Learning Researcher and Competitor with over 2 years experience, particularly in Computer Vision and Audio. My driving force? Making this world a better place with innovation of AI.

Just like a detective, I find joy in dissecting complex research problems and crafting solutions through code, and math. My perseverance has led to the [authorship of 5 papers and co-authorship of 2 more](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zrxJCYIAAAAJ). Beyond academia, I thrive in competitions like Kaggle, DrivenData, etc. It's here that I became one of the youngest [Kaggle Grandmasters](https://kaggle.com/awsaf49), peaking at 5th (now 7th) out of 285K participants. I also take pride in open-source contributing on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsaf49), in platforms such as TensorFlow, Keras, HuggingFace, YOLOv5, etc.
