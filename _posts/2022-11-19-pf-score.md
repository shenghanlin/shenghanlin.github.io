It may take a few moments for the Jupyter notebook to load. Thank you for your patience =)

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/notebook/pf_score.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/notebook/pf_score.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
